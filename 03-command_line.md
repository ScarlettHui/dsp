# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

> > __xargs__ is a command on Unix and most Unix-like oprating systems used to build and execute commands from standard input. It converts input from standard input into arguments to command  
<br/>  
One use case of xargs command is to remove a list of files using the _rm_ command  
`find /path -type f -print | xargs rm`  
<br/>  
the find utility feeds the input of xargs with a long list of file names. xargs then splits this list into sublists and calls rm once for every subilist
